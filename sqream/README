To use, add this to the interpreters section in conf/zeppelin-site.xml
(if this file doesn't exist, copy conf/zeppelin-site.xml.template):

org.apache.zeppelin.sqream.SqreamInterpreter

next to the org.apache.zeppelin.postgresql.PostgreSqlInterpreter in
the csv list in a property called zeppelin.interpreters

TODO:

use better names for the sqream jars

try to find a way to build just the sqream plugin for zeppelin using
ant then install into a working zeppelin instead of using the maven
shite

get the tests working, from the sqream source

the error messages when e.g. you get a database name wrong in
zeppelin front end are absolutely terrible


the sqream jars were added using these instructions:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/local-maven-dependencies

we should put sqream and the version numbers in the raw .jar file
names for sqream, and the names 'client' and 'wrapper' are meaningless
and should be improved.
